# TB Burden Country Analysis Dashboard

**Live App:** [tb-burden.streamlit.app](https://tb-burden.streamlit.app)

## Overview

This interactive Streamlit dashboard provides an analytical view of the **Global Tuberculosis (TB) Burden** using data from [Tableau’s sample dataset](https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/TB_Burden_Country.csv).  
The goal of this project is to visualize and understand trends in TB prevalence, incidence, and mortality across countries and years.

The app enables users to explore patterns and variations in TB metrics over time and compare countries to identify regions that require the most attention.

## Features

- **Country-wise TB analysis:** Explore data by country and year.
- **Trend visualization:** See how TB burden has changed globally and regionally over time.
- **Interactive plots:** Built using Plotly and Matplotlib for rich, dynamic visualizations.
- **Error-bound estimates:** Visualize upper and lower bounds for TB prevalence to understand uncertainty in data.
- **Clean UI:** Simple, intuitive Streamlit interface for seamless exploration.
