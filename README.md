# 🧬 TB Burden Country Analysis Dashboard

**Live App:** [tb-burden.streamlit.app](https://tb-burden.streamlit.app)

## 📊 Overview

This interactive Streamlit dashboard provides an analytical view of the **Global Tuberculosis (TB) Burden** using data from [Tableau’s sample dataset](https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/TB_Burden_Country.csv).  
The goal of this project is to visualize and understand trends in TB prevalence, incidence, and mortality across countries and years.

The app enables users to explore patterns and variations in TB metrics over time and compare countries to identify regions that require the most attention.
